- Technologies used:  
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript  
  - Jest(for unit testing)  

- What I learned:  
  - Using Jest for writing tests.  
  - Focused on modular functions.  
  - Using various Jest matchers to test conveniently.  
  
- Challenges I faced:  
  - When placing ships randomly, there existed cases where the last ship couldn't be placed anywhere on the board which lead to infinite while loop. The easiest way to fix this was by reducing the number of ships being placed.  
  - If the dialog is set to display: flex, it makes the dialog to get permanently displayed irrespective of the default invisible behavior. This was fixed by adding display: flex only when a player had won
